# Using a while loop, print 5 random numbers between 0 and 99 (inclusive)

# numbers = []
#
# while numbers.count < 5
#   num = rand(0..99)
#   numbers.push num
#   puts num
# end

# The following code outputs a countdown from 10 to 1. Modify the code so that it counts from 1 to 10 instead.

# count = 1
#
# until count == 11
#   puts count
#   count += 1
# end

# Given the array of several numbers below, use an until loop to print each number.

# numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]
# index = 0
#
# until index == numbers.size
#   puts numbers[index]
#   index += 1
# end

# The code below shows an example of a for loop. Modify the code so that it only outputs i if i is an odd number.

# for i in 1..100
#   if i % 2 != 0
#   puts i
# end
# end

# Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

for friend in friends
  puts "Hi " + friend + "!"
end
