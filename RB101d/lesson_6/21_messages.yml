    --------------------- Welcome to VEGAS-STAKES #{BUST}â„¢! ----------------------

    The goal is to get as close to #{BUST} as you can*. Number cards are worth
    their number value, face cards (jack/queen/king) are worth 10 and aces are
    worth either 1 or 11. After your first two cards are dealt, you can choose
    either hit (h) for another card or stay (s) if you are done with your turn.
    The dealer then takes their turn and will automatically hit until they
    reach at least #{DEALER_HIT_MINIMUM}. Winner is the one who has the highest score.
